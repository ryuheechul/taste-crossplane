- and [export your credentials](https://fluxcd.io/docs/get-started/#export-your-credentials)

### Run

### Apply Your Own Changes

- `make fix-repo` to point your forked repo not the original repo
- commit and push to `flux` branch

## Clean Up

### Code Style

- I try to minimize of imperative ways when it comes to both producing the code and using produced code
- for example, running multiple commands to install this and that
- I'm a big beliver on declarative programming and a big fan of relying on automated procedures
- that's also why there is a heavy usage on `kustomize` and `fluxcd` and even `nix`
- I want tools to do the job for me because they are better at it.
